### This is a learning project

This is a small project that I made in order to learn more about how the frameworks that use file system routing (like next.js or blitz.js) work. 

I also play around with the way that Blitz.js uses in order to type the resolvers. 


### How to use it

`cd` into the `lib` folder and run `npm link` and then `yarn watch`

Then `cd` into the example folder and run `npm link lib` and then `yarn watch` 

You'll get a live reloaded env in which you can make changes to the """""framework"""""" and it will reload the example env
